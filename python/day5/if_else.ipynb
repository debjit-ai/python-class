Next comes the relational operators. Finally, the logical operators are done last. This means that the expression x*5 >= 10 and y-6 <= 20 will be evaluated so as to first perform the arithmetic and then check the relationships. The and will be done last. Many programmers might place parentheses around the two relational expressions, (x*5 >= 10) and (y-6 <= 20). It is not necessary to do so, but causes no harm and may make it easier for people to read and understand the code."
